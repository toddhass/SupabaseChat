# How to Download and Run the SupabaseChat Project in Xcode

## Downloading the Project

To download the project files from Replit:

1. **Use the Replit download feature:**
   - Click on the three dots (â‹®) menu in the top-right corner of the Replit interface
   - Select "Download as ZIP"
   - This will download all the project files as a ZIP archive

2. **Extract the ZIP file** to a location on your computer

## Setting Up in Xcode

### Option 1: Creating a New Xcode Project with the Downloaded Files

1. **Create a new Xcode project:**
   - Open Xcode
   - Select "File" > "New" > "Project..."
   - Choose iOS or macOS app template (depending on your target platform)
   - Select SwiftUI for the interface
   - Name your project "SupabaseChat"

2. **Add the Swift files from the ZIP:**
   - Copy the contents of the `SupabaseChat` folder from the ZIP to your Xcode project
   - Create the matching folder structure (Models, Services, Views, Utilities)
   - Add the additional Swift files that demonstrate Supabase connectivity:
     - `supabase_auth_demo.swift`
     - `supabase_chat_api.swift`
     - `user_status.swift`

3. **Set up the Supabase Swift SDK:**
   - In Xcode, go to "File" > "Add Packages..."
   - Paste the URL: `https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-swift`
   - Click "Add Package"

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Edit your scheme in Xcode: "Product" > "Scheme" > "Edit Scheme..."
   - Select "Run" from the left sidebar
   - Go to the "Arguments" tab
   - Under "Environment Variables", add:
     - SUPABASE_URL: Your Supabase project URL
     - SUPABASE_KEY: Your Supabase public API key

### Option 2: Using the XcodeSupabaseChatApp.swift Template

The downloaded ZIP includes `XcodeSupabaseChatApp.swift`, which is a standalone SwiftUI app template that demonstrates how to integrate with Supabase. You can:

1. Create a new SwiftUI project in Xcode
2. Replace the auto-generated App and ContentView files with the content from `XcodeSupabaseChatApp.swift`
3. Add the Supabase Swift SDK as a dependency

## Setting Up Your Supabase Backend

1. **Create a Supabase project** if you don't have one already at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. **Run the SQL setup script:**
   - Open the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy the content of `create.sql` from the downloaded ZIP file
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor and run it

3. **Follow the additional setup steps** in the `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` file

## Project Structure

The downloaded ZIP contains:

1. **Main SupabaseChat Application:**
   - `SupabaseChat/` folder with a complete SwiftUI application

2. **Demo Files:**
   - `supabase_auth_demo.swift`: Demonstrates authentication with Supabase
   - `supabase_chat_api.swift`: Shows how to interact with the Supabase API
   - `user_status.swift`: Examples for tracking user online status

3. **Documentation:**
   - `README-XCODE.md`: Comprehensive guide for Xcode setup
   - `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`: Instructions for setting up your Supabase project
   - `create.sql`: SQL script for creating all required database tables

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure your Supabase URL and API key are correctly configured
2. Check that you've run the SQL setup script in your Supabase project
3. Verify that you've installed the Supabase Swift SDK correctly in your Xcode project
